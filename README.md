# CS408 - Lab9.2

## Overview

TODO: Write a project description

This project takes a starting site that generates many balls with different colors and velocities. In this project, the site was updated to spawn in an evil circle object that eats the balls that are bouncing around the screen. 

## Sources and Credits

I think that the instructions on canvas were helpful enough for this project!
